 During this session a solution was performed using 6 CPU cores in       
 shared-memory parallel (SMP) mode (-np 6).  It is strongly recommended  
 to use distributed memory parallel (DMP) mode instead (-dis -np 6).     
 DMP mode typically outperforms SMP mode, even when running on a single  
 system.  For more information, see the ANSYS Parallel Processing Guide  
 in the ANSYS Help system.
